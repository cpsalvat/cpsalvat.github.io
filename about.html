        <div class="story">
          <p>
          It all started at a Valentine's Day craft party in 2013, where we were both making 
          Valentines for our moms. Maybe there was magic in the air that night, or maybe it was
          just all the glitter, but either way, we decided to go out for brunch the next day, and
          we've been adventuring together ever since.
          </p><p>
          Over the last three years we've camped and hiked and snowboarded our way through the 
          Cascade Mountains. We've been whiskey tasting in Scotland, 
          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munro#Bagging_the_Munros">
          bagged a Munro,</a> spotted a cougar in Glacier, climbed to the top of Machu Picchu and
          faced the <a target="_blank"

          Stairs of Death,</a> and made friends with some very pushy sea lions in the Galapagos. After
          all of that, we eventually realized that we made a pretty good team, and we should probably
          stick together.

          Ben proposed on the wildflower-covered plateau at the top of 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/steamboat-rock">
          Steamboat Rock.</a> Christina said yes. Well, technically, Christina said "of course!" - 
          she was pretty excited. And now we're both excited to start our next adventure together 
          with all of you to share it!
