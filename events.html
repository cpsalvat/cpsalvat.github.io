        <h1>Heather Lake Hike</h1>
        <h1><small>Saturday, May 27th 10:00am</small></h1>
        <p>
          Please join us to get some fresh air and relaxation in the day before the ceremony! In the
          true spirit of the Pacific Northwest, we'll be hiking rain or shine, and would love for you
          to join us!
        </p><p>
          The trail is 4.6 miles roundtrip, and not too steep, so it should be fairly accessible
          for most. The trailhead is about an hour and twenty minute drive from Seattle, so please
          plan accordingly.
        </p><p>

        <h1>Exploring Seattle</h1>
        We love living in Seattle, and one of the things we're most excited about is getting the
        opportunity to share our city with our friends and family! If you're going to be in the
        area for a while before or after the wedding, here are some of our favorite places!
        <h2>Things to Do</h2>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
          <h2><small>
            <a href="http://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/" target="_blank">Chihuly Garden and Glass</a>
          </small></h2>
          Museum showing beautiful glass work by Dale Chihuly. It's a little pricey, but totally
          beautiful.
          <h2><small>
            <a href="http://pikeplacemarket.org/" target="_blank">Pike Place Market</a>
          </small></h2>
          Yes, it may be touristy, but it's also a lot of fun to visit! Lots of flowers and crafts 
          and produce, plus guys who throw fish.
          <h2><small>
            <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?id=399" target="_blank">Volunteer Park</a>
          </small></h2>
          A beautiful park with a water tower containing fascinating history and great views of
          the city. The park also has several lovely gardens, a small greenhouse, and the Seattle
          Asian Art Museum.
          <h2><small>
            <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?ID=243" target="_blank">Golden Gardens</a>
          </small></h2>
          One of Seattle's few beaches, with a gorgeous view of the Olympic Mountains! Great to 
          visit around sunset.
          <h2><small>
            <a href="http://www.ballardlocks.org/" target="_blank">Ballard Locks</a>
          </small></h2>
          Watching boats going through the locks is pretty cool. As an added bonus, there's a 
          lovely little park and a fish ladder!
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
          <h2><small>
            <a href="http://seattlefarmersmarkets.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Farmers Markets</a>
          </small></h2>
          Lots of wonderful food and local crafts! Most are on Sundays, if you're looking for 
          something to do the morning before the ceremony.
          <h2><small>
            <a href="https://www.theochocolate.com/" target="_blank">Theo Chocolate</a>
          </small></h2>
          Small but mighty bean-to-bar chocolate factory in Fremont! Take a factory tour
          (be sure to book ahead online), or just swing by to taste some amazing chocolate.
          <h2><small>
            <a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/" target="_blank">Museum of Flight</a>
          </small></h2>
          Seattle is home to Boeing, which means that we've got a little bit of a thing about 
          airplanes. It will make you interested in airplanes even if you didn't think you were
          interested in airplanes.
          <h2><small>
            <a href="http://www.spl.org/locations/central-library" target="_blank">Seattle Central Public Library</a>
          </small></h2>
          Really cool contemporary building - definitely worth checking out if you'll be downtown.
